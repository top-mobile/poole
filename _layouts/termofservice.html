  </p>
  These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of our services, including our various websites and
  applications, and our other covered services that link to these Terms (collectively, the “Services”), and any
  information, text, graphics, photos, videos or other materials uploaded, downloaded or appearing on the Services
  (collectively referred to as “Content”). Your access to and use of the Services are conditioned on your acceptance of
  and compliance with these Terms. By accessing or using the Services you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do
  not agree to be bound by all of these Terms, including the mandatory arbitration provision and class action waiver in
  Section 11, do not access or use the Services.
   
  <h3>1. Basic terms</h3>

  person's credit card information, social security or alternate national identity numbers, non-public phone numbers
  or non-public email addresses.</p>
  
  <p>You are solely responsible for your use of the Services, for any Content you post to the Services, and for any
  consequences thereof. Most Content you submit, post, or display through the Services is public by default and will
  be able to be viewed by other users. You should only provide Content that you are comfortable sharing with others
  under these Terms.</p>
  <p>You are solely responsible for any activity that occurs through your account and accept all risks of
  unauthorized

  someone has accessed your account without your permission. You agree you will not sell, transfer, license or assign
  your account, followers, username, or any account rights. With the exception of people or commercial or
  non-commercial entities that are expressly authorized to create accounts on behalf of their employers or clients,
  you agree that you will not create an account for anyone other than yourself.</p>
  <p>You may use the Services only if you can form a binding contract with Groovy Dev and are not a person barred
  from
  receiving services under the laws of the United States or other applicable jurisdiction. If you are accepting these
  Terms and using the Services on behalf of a company, organization, government, or other legal entity, you represent
  and warrant that you are authorized to do so. You may use the Services only in compliance with these Terms and all
  applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules and regulations.</p>
  <p>The Services that Groovy Dev provides are always evolving and the form and nature of the Services that Groovy
  Dev
  provides may change from time to time without prior notice to you. If we make a change to these terms that, in our
  sole discretion, is material, we will notify you in the relevant application. In addition, Groovy Dev may stop
  (permanently or temporarily) providing the Services (or any features within the Services) to you or to users
  generally and may not be able to provide you with prior notice. We also retain the right to create limits on use and
  storage at our sole discretion at any time without prior notice to you.</p>

  collection and use (as set forth in the Privacy Policy) of this information, including the transfer of this
  information to the United States for storage, processing and use by Groovy Dev. As part of providing you the
  Services, we may need to provide you with certain communications, such as service announcements and administrative
  messages. These communications are considered part of the Services and your account, which you may not be able to
  opt-out from receiving.</p>

  Content posted to the Services, we may delete or remove such Content at any time and for any reason. Any use of or
  reliance on any Content or materials posted via the Services or obtained by you through the Services is at your own
  risk.</p>

  any
  Content or communications posted via the Services or endorse any opinions expressed via the Services. You understand
  that by using the Services, you may be exposed to Content that might be offensive, harmful, inaccurate or otherwise
  inappropriate, or in some cases, postings that have been mislabeled or are otherwise deceptive. Under no
  circumstances will Groovy Dev be liable in any way for any Content, including, but not limited to, any errors or
  omissions in any Content, or any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of any Content posted,
  emailed, transmitted or otherwise made available via the Services or broadcast elsewhere.</p>

  otherwise make available through the Services.</p>

  Services. If you stop using the Services without deactivating your accounts, your accounts may be deactivated due to
  prolonged inactivity.</p>
  
  <p>We may suspend or terminate your accounts or cease providing you with all or part of the Services at any timefor any

  <h3>10. Disclaimers and Limitations of Liability</h3>
  
  <p>Please read this section carefully since it limits the liability of Groovy Dev and its parents, subsidiaries,
  affiliates, related companies, officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives, partners, and licensors
  (collectively, the "Groovy Dev Entities"). Each of the subsections below only applies up to the maximum extent
  permitted under applicable law. Some jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of implied warranties or the
  limitation of liability in contracts, and as a result the contents of this section may not apply to you. Nothing in
  this section is intended to limit any rights you may have which may not be lawfully limited.</p>
  
  <p>We do not control, endorse or take responsibility for any third-party content available on or linked to by our
  Services, including Content posted by our users.</p>
  
  <h4>The Services are Available "AS-IS"</h4>

  <p>Your access to and use of the Services or any Content are at your own risk. You understand and agree that the
  Services are provided to you on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. Without limiting the foregoing, to the maximum
  extent permitted under applicable law, THE Groovy Dev ENTITIES DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, WHETHER
  EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
  PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>
  
  <p>The Groovy Dev Entities make no warranty or representation and disclaim all responsibility and liability for: (i)
  the completeness, accuracy, availability, timeliness, security or reliability of the Services or any Content; (ii)
  any harm to your computer system, loss of data, or other harm that results from your access to or use of the
  Services or any Content; (iii) the deletion of, or the failure to store or to transmit, any Content and other
  communications maintained by the Services; and (iv) whether the Services will meet your requirements or be available
  on an uninterrupted, secure, or error-free basis. No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained from
  the Groovy Dev Entities or through the Services, will create any warranty or representation not expressly made
  herein.</p>
  <h4>Limitation of Liability</h4>
  <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE Groovy Dev ENTITIES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT,
  INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED
  DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOOD-WILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM (i) YOUR
  ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES; (ii) ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY ON
  THE SERVICES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY DEFAMATORY, OFFENSIVE OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT OF OTHER USERS OR THIRD
  PARTIES; (iii) ANY CONTENT OBTAINED FROM THE SERVICES; OR (iv) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE OR ALTERATION OF YOUR
  TRANSMISSIONS OR CONTENT.</p>
  
  <p>IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF THE Groovy Dev ENTITIES EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU PAID Groovy Dev, IF ANY,
  IN THE PAST SIX MONTHS FOR THE SERVICES GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM.</p>
  
  <p>THE LIMITATIONS OF THIS SUBSECTION SHALL APPLY TO ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT,
  STATUTE, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER OR NOT THE Groovy Dev ENTITIES HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF
  THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH DAMAGE, AND EVEN IF A REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL
  PURPOSE.</p>
  <h3>11. Arbitration Provision/Class-Action Waiver</h3>
  Please read the following section carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with
  Groovy Dev and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us.
   
  <p>Except for any dispute arising out of or related to a violation of Section 7 or the Groovy Dev Rules, or disputes in
  which either party seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court, if the dispute meets the requirements
  to be heard in small claims court, or seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of
  intellectual property, you and Groovy Dev waive your rights to a jury trial and to have any dispute arising out of
  or related to these Terms or the Services resolved in court. Instead, all disputes arising out of or relating to
  these Terms or the Services will be resolved through confidential binding arbitration held in San Mateo County,
  California before and in accordance with the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures ("Rules") of the Judicial
  Arbitration and Mediation Services ("JAMS"), which are available on the JAMS website and hereby incorporated by
  reference. You either acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the rules of JAMS or waive your
  opportunity to read the rules of JAMS and any claim that the rules of JAMS are unfair or should not apply for any
  reason.</p>
  <p>You and Groovy Dev agree that any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or the Services is personal to
  you and Groovy Dev and that any dispute will be resolved solely through individual arbitration and will not be
  brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding.</p>
  <p>You and Groovy Dev agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the enforceability of this Section 11
  will be substantively and procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq. (the "FAA"),
  to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the JAMS Rules, the
  arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any dispute and
  to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court; provided, however, that the arbitrator does not have
  the authority to conduct a class arbitration or a representative action, which is prohibited by these Terms. The
  arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims,
  preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one
  individual. You and Groovy Dev agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the filing fee and Company
  will pay the remaining JAMS fees and costs. For any arbitration initiated by Groovy Dev , Groovy Dev will pay all
  JAMS fees and costs. You and Groovy Dev agree that the state or federal courts of the State of California and the
  United States sitting in San Mateo County, California have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the
  enforcement of an arbitration award.
  <p>Any claim you may have arising out of or related to these Terms or the Services must be filed within one year after
  such claim arose; otherwise, your claim is permanently barred, which means that you and Groovy Dev will not have the
  right to assert the claim.</p>
  <p>You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within thirty (30) days of the date you first accepted the
  terms of this Section 11 by emailing us at legal [at] ticktockapps [dot] com. In order to be effective, the opt out
  notice must include your full name and clearly indicate your intent to opt out of binding arbitration. By opting out
  of binding arbitration, you are agreeing to resolve Disputes in accordance with Section 12.</p>
  
  <h3>12. General Terms</h3>
  <h4>Waiver and Severability</h4>

  The failure of Groovy Dev to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be deemed a waiver of such right
  or provision. In the event that any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, then that
  provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions of these Terms
  will remain in full force and effect.
   
  <h4>Law and Jurisdiction</h4>
  These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to
  or application of its conflict of law provisions or your state or country of residence. All claims, legal
  proceedings or litigation arising in connection with the Services will be brought solely in the federal or state
  courts located in San Mateo County, California, United States, and you consent to the jurisdiction of and venue in
  such courts and waive any objection as to inconvenient forum.
   
  <br>If you are a federal, state, or local government entity in the United States using the Services in your official
  capacity and legally unable to accept the controlling law, jurisdiction or venue clauses above, then those clauses
  do not apply to you. For such U.S. federal government entities, these Terms and any action related thereto will be
  governed by the laws of the United States of America (without reference to conflict of laws) and, in the absence of
  federal law and to the extent permitted under federal law, the laws of the State of California (excluding choice of
  law).
   
  <h4>Entire Agreement</h4>
  These Terms, including the Groovy Dev Rules for the Groovy Dev Services, our Privacy Policy are the entire and
  exclusive agreement between Groovy Dev and you regarding the Services (excluding any services for which you have a
  separate agreement with Groovy Dev that is explicitly in addition or in place of these Terms), and these Terms
  supersede and replace any prior agreements between Groovy Dev and you regarding the Services.
