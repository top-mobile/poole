Manga Rock is a free go-to app for all your manga reading needs. It provides access to an extensive catalogue of the most popular Manga titles available. You can discover, read and download manga with this awesome app. There are 24 sources and 7 different languages of manga to choose from, and you will certainly find the desirable manga out there.

Its unique “FOR YOU” option discovers new manga, great authors, or “hidden gems” through recommendation. The “RECENT” option lets you see your recent activity. You can get recommendations, see popular ones, view related ones and more. Manga Rock has three different reading modes and advanced reading settings which gives you a seamless reading experience, and you can customize it any way you want. It also allows you to read both vertically or horizontally, adjust the brightness, change reading direction, and zoom in and out.

This app is light on the battery, has push notifications, save your favorites, pick up where you left off reading, sync and read between iOS devices, backup to the Manga Rock Cloud, and allows you to download mangas. What’s awesome is next chapter automatically downloads in the background when you are reading the manga.

One of the noticeable problems for Manga Rock is some pages won't load for certain chapters when reading a Manga title online. Another downside that more and more users mention is they’re constantly getting mangas that aren't fully downloaded and pages are never loading with the recent versions of the app. The downloading system and performance were way better before the developers released the later versions. Hope the issues can be fixed soon.

The most fantastic feature that distinguishes Manga Bird from other manga readers is how easy it is to manage storage! It checks storage size of every read manga in storage management.

In the meantime, it also has some areas need to improved: the developers may give it a more advanced filtering system, so you can choose to see titles in two or more categories and maybe blacklist some when you're browsing. Maybe try to set folders or dividers for my favorites tab, or a way to customize the colors. Well, we’ll see whether the users’ wishes are realized in the new releases of Manga Bird in the future.

# Manga Fox

This looked like a good manga reader. It can display manga from multiple websites, and it is still more convenient than reading on a website. However, I paid to get rid of ads, and they are still showing up. This is very annoying, since the ads are animated and cause the manga image to be reduced in size.

 You can download it via [Apple App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/US/app/id1108671336?l=en)

# Manga Hub
